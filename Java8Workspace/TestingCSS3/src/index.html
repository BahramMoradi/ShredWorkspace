        <h1>domestic dog!!!</h1>
            <p>
                The domestic <abbr title="lovely dog ....">dog</abbr> (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris)[2] is a domesticated canid which has been <br>
                selectively bred over millennia for various behaviours, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[3]<br>

                Although initially thought to have originated as an artificial variant of an extant canid species<br>
                (variously supposed as being the dhole,[4] golden jackal,[5] or gray wolf[6]), extensive genetic <br>
                studies undertaken during the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in <br>
                Eurasia 40,000 years ago.[7] Their long association with humans has led to dogs being uniquely <br>
                attuned to human behavior[8] and able to thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate <br>
                for other canid species.[9] Dogs are also the oldest domesticated animal. One unusual characteristic <br>
                of dogs, resulting from their selective breeding, is that they very widely vary in shape, size and <br>
                colours, which are disposed in breeds.[10]<br>

                Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting<br>
                police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals.<br>
                This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet, "man's best friend".<br>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>
            The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The English word<br>
                dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".[11] The term may <br>
                possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukkōn, represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-muscle").<br>
                [12] The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", <br>
                stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.[13] The term dog may ultimately derive from the <br>
                earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary.[14]<br>

            In 14th-century England, hound (from Old English: hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and <br>
                dog referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this "dog" type was <br>
                so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category "hound".[15] By the 16th century, dog had <br>
                become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.[16] The word <br>
                "hound" is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European word *kwon-, "dog".[17]<br>
                A male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch. The father of a litter is <br>
                called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, <br>
                ultimately from Old Norse bikkja) The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word hwelp.[18]<br>
                A litter refers to the multiple offspring at one birth which are called puppies or pups from the French <br>
                poupée.[19]
